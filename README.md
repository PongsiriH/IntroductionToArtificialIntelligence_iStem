# Artificial Intelligence with hands-on exercises: maze-solver, crawling robot and emotion recognition

This aim to be a supplmentary for the paper: (link to paper in the future). 


# A* maze-solver
This section describe how to use graph traversal algorithm to solve a maze game, in particular A* algorithm.
It would be helpful to understand greedy best-first search (https://youtu.be/Uzraf9TYhjY) for this section.

# Q-learning/Reinforcement learning
This section introduces Q-learning, an algorithm that allows an *agent* to learn a sequence of *actions* from its *environment* without being explicitly instructed. The agent does not receive direct instructions but is *rewarded* when the crawling robot moves forward. Q-learning is applied and updated as rewards are given, enabling the robot to learn the optimal strategy for different levels of friction.

# Principal Components Analysis
This section discusses the change of basis and how the same data can be represented differently.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix can be used as the *optimal* basis, a technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We then apply PCA to images of angry and happy faces.
